This series of posts will be a documentation of my attempts to understand Seiberg-Witten theory. This particular post will focus on the linear algebra foundations: Clifford algebras and the spinor representation. I am using Marcolli's Seiberg-Witten Gauge Theory, Nicolaescu's Notes on Seiberg-Witten Theory and Salamon's Spin Geometry and Seiberg-Witten Invariants as the main sources to learn. Apologies for errors, and comments are welcome.

The real Clifford algebra on $$n$$ generators and $$+_n$$ signature $$\mathrm{Cliff}_{n, 0}$$ is the algebra generated by $$n$$ symbols $$e_1, \cdots, e_n$$ satisfying the anticommutation relations $$\{e_i, e_j\} = e_i e_j + e_j e_i = -2 \delta_{ij}$$. This is closely related to the exterior algebra on $$n$$ generators $$\Lambda_n$$ generated by $$n$$ symbols $$e_1, \cdots, e_n$$ satisfying the anticommutation relations $$\{e_i, e_j\} = e_i \wedge e_j + e_j \wedge e_i = 0$$, except in the former we have the identities $$e_i^2 = -1$$ for all $$1 \leq i \leq n$$; indeed they are isomorphic as graded vector spaces with basis consisting of monomials on $$e_1, \cdots, e_n$$ with degree of each $$e_i$$ either $$0$$ or $$1$$. In particular, $$\dim \mathrm{Cliff}_{n, 0} = \dim \Lambda_n = 2^n$$. 

One might think of $$\mathrm{Cliff}_{n, 0}$$ as trying to mimic the quaternions $$\mathrm{Cliff}_{2, 0} \cong \Bbb H$$ (identify $$e_1 \mapsto i, e_2 \mapsto j, e_1 e_2 \mapsto k$$) in higher dimensions. Recall that $$\Bbb H$$ carries a natural norm $$|a + bi + cj + dk| = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$$, and therefore one could look at the unit-norm quaternions, which would be the locus of points $$(a, b, c, d)$$ satisfying $$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1$$ the underlying space of such being $$S^3 \subset \Bbb H \cong \Bbb R^4$$. But the quaternionic multiplication now restricts to $$S^3$$, making it a Lie group, just like the complex multiplication on $$\Bbb C$$ makes the unit circle $$S^1 \subset \Bbb C \cong \Bbb R^2$$ a Lie group. There is a natural representation $$\Bbb H \to M_2(\Bbb C)$$ of the quaternion algebra in the space of $$2 \times 2$$ matrices given by the so called Pauli matrices, 

$$\displaystyle 1 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \, i \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \, j \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\ 0 & -i \end{pmatrix}, \, k \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

The image of the unit sphere in $$\Bbb H \cong \Bbb R^4$$ under this representation consists of exactly the $$2 \times 2$$ unitary matrices (that is, $$A^\dagger A = I$$) with determinant $$1$$, that is, the special unitary group $$SU(2)$$. Thus, $$S^3$$ with the Lie group structure given by quaternionic multiplication is isomorphic to the familiar Lie group $$SU(2)$$. 

We shall construct similar representations $$\mathrm{Cliff}_{2m, 0} \to M_{2^m}(\Bbb C)$$. First we introduce the complexified Clifford algebra $$\mathrm{Cliff}_{n, 0} \otimes \Bbb C$$ which is defined mutatis mutandis except the coefficients associated to the standard basis of monomials can be taken to be complex numbers now. In this setup, let $$e_1, \cdots, e_m, f_1, \cdots, f_m$$ denote the standard generators of $$\mathrm{Cliff}_{2m, 0}$$. Define $$v_k = (e_k + i f_k)/\sqrt{2}$$ for all $$1 \leq k \leq m$$. Then the subspace $$V$$ spanned by $$v_1, \cdots, v_m$$ has the property that the Clifford multiplication restricts to the exterior algebra on $$V$$, i.e., $$V$$ is totally isotropic with respect to the complexified dot product $$z \cdot w = \sum_i z_i w_i$$. Therefore, we can decompose $$\Bbb C^{2m} = V \oplus V^*$$ by considering the map $$\Bbb C^n \to V^*$$ sending $$z$$ to the linear functional $$z \cdot (-)$$ on $$V$$, which has kernel precisely $$V$$. There's a natural way to make the exterior algebra $$\Lambda_m$$ generated by $$v_1, \cdots, v_m$$ a module over $$\mathrm{Cliff}_{2m, 0}$$ by defining the action of elements of $$\Bbb C^{2m} = V \oplus V^*$$ as follows:

$$\displaystyle v \cdot (w_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge w_k) = v \wedge w_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge w_k \\ \phi \cdot (w_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge w_k) = \sum_{j = 1}^k (-1)^j \phi(w_j) w_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{w_j} \wedge \cdots \wedge w_k$$

For any $$v \in V, \phi \in V^*$$. The complex spinor representation is simply this representation $$\varphi : \mathrm{Cliff}_{2m, 0}\otimes \Bbb C \to \mathrm{End}(\Lambda_m) \cong M_{2^m}(\Bbb C)$$. We can make this a bit more explicit by choosing a basis for everything: the copy of $$V^*$$ sitting inside $$\Bbb C^{2m}$$ is spanned by the conjugates $$\overline{v}_k = (e_k - i f_k)/\sqrt{2}$$, $$1 \leq k \leq m$$. Indeed one can check the relations $$v_i \cdot v_j = \overline{v}_i \cdot \overline{v}_j = 0$$ and $$\overline{v}_i \cdot v_j = v_i \cdot \overline{v}_j = \delta_{ij}$$ for all $$1 \leq i, j \leq m$$. The representation restricts to a representation of $$\mathrm{Cliff}_{2m, 0} \subset \mathrm{Cliff}_{2m, 0} \otimes \Bbb C$$ by $$\varphi(e_k) = v_k \wedge \cdot - \iota_{\overline{v}_k}(\cdot)$$ and $$\varphi(f_k) = i(v_k \wedge \cdot + \iota_{\overline{v}_k}(\cdot))$$, where $$\wedge$$ denotes the exterior product and $$\iota$$ denotes the contraction operator.

At this point it is a good idea to switch to coordinate-free language to consolidate various points. Let $$(V, \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle)$$ be an even-dimensional real inner product space and $$J$$ be a complex structure on $$V$$, that is, $$J \in \mathrm{End}(V)$$ such that $$J^2 = -I$$ which is moreover compatible with the inner product in the sense that $$J$$ is an isometry, i.e., $$\langle Jv, Jw\rangle = \langle v, w\rangle$$. Then the complexification of $$V$$ splits as $$V \otimes \Bbb C = V^{1, 0} \oplus V^{0, 1}$$ where $$V^{1, 0}, V^{0, 1}$$ are the eigenspaces of $$J$$ with eigenvalue $$\pm i$$ respectively. The real Clifford algebra $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0} V^{\otimes n}/(v \otimes w + w \otimes v + 2\langle v, w\rangle)$$ is a quotient of the full tensor algebra by two-sided ideal generated by the appropriate commutation relations. The complex Clifford algebra $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V) \otimes \Bbb C$$ has a representation on the exterior algebra $$\Lambda^\bullet V^{1, 0}$$ by $$v \mapsto v \wedge \cdot$$ if $$v \in V^{1, 0}$$ and $$\overline{v} \mapsto \iota_{\overline{v}}$$ if $$\overline{v} \in V^{0, 1}$$, where we treat $$\overline{v}$$ as the covector $$\langle \overline{v}, \cdot \rangle_{\Bbb C}$$ acting on $$V^{0, 1}$$ where $$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_{\Bbb C}$$ is the complexified inner product. The representation map $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V) \otimes \Bbb C \to \mathrm{End}(\Lambda^{\bullet} V^{1, 0})$$ is in fact an isomorphism: first note $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V_1 \oplus V_2) \cong \mathrm{Cliff}(V_1) \widehat{\otimes} \mathrm{Cliff}(V_2)$$ and $$\mathrm{End}(\Lambda^{\bullet} (V_1 \oplus V_2)) \cong \mathrm{End}(\Lambda^{\bullet} V_1) \widehat{\otimes} \mathrm{End}(\Lambda^\bullet V_2)$$. By decomposing $$V^{1, 0}$$ into $$1$$-dimensional subspaces we obtain that the representation map is obtained from direct sum of the representation maps of the form $$\mathrm{Cliff}(L) \otimes \Bbb C \to \mathrm{End}(\Lambda^{\bullet} L^{1, 0})$$ where $$L$$ is $$1$$-dimensional, which are clearly isomorphisms.

This shows $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V) \otimes \Bbb C \cong \mathrm{End}(\Lambda^{\bullet} V^{1, 0})$$ which is a matrix ring, and therefore $$\Lambda^{\bullet} V^{1, 0}$$ must be a simple module over it, i.e., it is an irreducible representation of $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V) \otimes \Bbb C$$. One can restrict this representation to the real Clifford algebra, and it follows from the coordinate computations above that it is explicitly given by $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V) \to \mathrm{End}(\Lambda^{\bullet} V^{1, 0})$$, $$v \mapsto (v - Jv) \wedge \cdot - \iota_{(v - Jv)^*}$$ where $$w^* = \langle w, \cdot \rangle$$ is the covector associated to $$w$$. From now onwards we denote $$S = \Lambda^{\bullet} V^{1, 0}$$ to be this complex spinor representation of $$\mathrm{Cliff}_{2m, 0}$$ of complex dimension $$2^m$$. 

From the discussions before, $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V) \cong \Lambda^\bullet(V)$$ as graded vector spaces for any real inner product space $$V$$, even though the algebra structure is very much different. Under this identification we can segregate the subspaces of $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V)$$ generated by even-length words on a chosen orthobasis $$e_1, \cdots, e_n$$ and the one generated by odd-length words: $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V) \cong \mathrm{Cliff}^+(V) \oplus \mathrm{Cliff}^-(V)$$. The Clifford algebra as well as the exterior algebra is a superalgebra in the sense that it admits such a decomposition graded by $$\Bbb Z/2 = \{+, -\}$$ in a way that the multiplication of the algebra preserves these "islands" modulo $$2$$, i.e., $$++ = +$$, $$+- = -+ = -$$, $$-- = +$$. Finally, (multiples of) the highest degree term $$\varepsilon := e_1 \cdots e_n$$ in $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V)$$ is called the volume form in analogy with that of the exterior algebra. In case $$n = 2m$$, observe that $$\varepsilon^2 = (-1)^m$$, therefore the matrix of $$\varepsilon$$ acting on $$S$$ has two distinct eigenvalues, $$\pm i^m$$ (the isomorphism of central simple algebras $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V) \otimes \Bbb C \to \mathrm{End}(S)$$ implies $$\varepsilon$$ cannot act by a scalar as it is not a scalar). Therefore, there is a decomposition $$S = S^+ \oplus S^-$$ into the eigenspaces of $$\varepsilon$$. Observe that for any $$1 \leq i \leq 2m$$, $$\varepsilon e_i = -e_i \varepsilon$$, so for all $$v \in V$$, $$\varepsilon v = - v \varepsilon$$. As a corollary, any $$v \in V \subset \mathrm{Cliff}(V)$$ acts on $$S$$ by switching $$S^{\pm}$$.

At this point, we stop and make a general definition. Given a real inner product space $$(V, \langle \cdot, \cdot\rangle)$$ of dimension $$2m$$, a spinc structure on $$V$$ is choice of a representation $$\rho : V \to \mathrm{End}(W)$$ in a complex $$2^m$$-dimensional Hermitian inner product space $$W$$ such that $$\rho(v) + \rho(v)^\dagger = 0$$ and $$\rho(v) \rho(v)^\dagger = \|v\|^2 \mathrm{id}_W$$. Equivalently, it is a representation $$\phi : \mathrm{Cliff}(V) \to \mathrm{End}(W)$$ of $$\star$$-algebras, which restricts to $$\rho$$ on $$V$$. To see the equivalence, one can define $$\phi(v_1 \cdots v_n) := \rho(v_1) \cdots \rho(v_n)$$; then it is easy to check $$\phi(vw + wv) = -\langle v, w\rangle\mathrm{id}_W$$ from the properties of $$\phi$$. The spinor representation $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V) \to \mathrm{End}(S)$$ defines a canonical spinc structure on any real inner product space. It is moreover easily checked that for any spinc structure, the representation map $$\phi$$ is an isomorphism; indeed, $$\mathrm{Cliff}(V)$$ is a (central) simple algebra, hence the map is injective, and by dimension reasons ($$\dim W = 2^m$$) it must also be surjective. Finally, it follows from the Skolem-Noether theorem that any two spinc structures on a real inner product space are isomorphic in the sense that the corresponding representations are conjugate.

Eventually we shall discuss the notion of a spinor bundle $$S$$ on a Riemannian manifold $$(M, g)$$ of dimension $$2m$$, which shall be a module over the Clifford algebra bundle $$\mathrm{Cliff}(TM)$$ of rank $$2^m$$. The main subtlety is that even though this looks like the above construction parametrized over a manifold $$M$$, a spinor bundle need not always exist; existence of such a thing is equivalent to the more familiar notion of existence of a spinc structure on $$M$$. This will be discussed in detail in a future post. Up next, some discussions regarding the $$\mathrm{Spin}(n)$$ and $$\mathrm{Spin}^{\Bbb C}(n)$$ groups.
