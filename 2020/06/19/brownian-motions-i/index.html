    <p>This will be part of (hopefully) a series of notes I will write down whilst preparing for some informal talks in a study group, in the process of understanding Brownian motions. I am reading mainly from Robert Haslhofer’s course notes available here, although I might occasionally use other resources, most notably perhaps Durrett’s “Probability: Theory and Examples”. Be warned that I have a less than adequate understanding of probability and I might make many mistakes and have fundamental misunderstandings; these notes are written mostly for personal bookkeeping purposes.

<p>A real-valued continuous time stochastic process is a measurable function \(X : \Omega \times [0, \infty) \to \Bbb R\) for some probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \Bbb {P})\), which we think of as a family of random variables \(\{X_t\}_{t \geq 0}\) defined on this probability space. Such a process \(B : \Omega \times [0, \infty) \to \Bbb R\) is a Brownian motion starting at \(x_0 \in \Bbb R\) if \(B_0 = x_0\), the process has independent increments, i.e., for \(0 \leq t_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_k\) the increments \(B_{t_2} - B_{t_1}, \cdots, B_{t_k} - B_{t_{k-1}}\) are independent random variables and moreover the increments have a Gaussian law: \(B_{t + h} - B_t \sim N(0, h)\) for any \(t \geq 0\), \(h &gt; 0\). Finally, we demand that the process is sample-continuous, that is, the event \(\{\omega \in \Omega : t \mapsto B_t(\omega) \text{ is continuous}\} \subset \Omega\) contains an \(\mathcal{A}\)-measurable subset of probability \(1\).</p>

<p>I will devote the post to establishing existence of Brownian motions. A particularly appealing approach is to try to construct a Brownian motion as a random ray on \(\Bbb R\). To set it up, let us denote \(C[0, \infty)\) as the space of continuous maps \(\gamma : [0, \infty) \to \Bbb R\), and \(C_0\) be the subspace of all such maps \(\gamma\) such that \(\gamma(0) = 0\). We equip this space with the compact-open topology, and let \(\mathcal{B}(C_0)\) denote the Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra. We would like the Brownian motion to be a random variable \(B : (\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \Bbb P) \to (C_0, \mathcal{B}(C_0))\) valued in this space. We can switch perspectives by trying to construct the pushforward measure \(\mu_B := B_* \Bbb P\) instead, at which point the Brownian motion will be the random variable defined on the probability space \((C_0, \mathcal{B}(C_0), \mu_B)\) tautologically by \(B : (C_0, \mathcal{B}(C_0), \mu_B) \to (C_0, \mathcal{B}(C_0))\) with \(B(\gamma) = \gamma\).</p>

<p>We start by considering open subsets of \(C_0\) of the following form: Let \(0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_k\) be a finite sequence of times and \(U_1, \cdots, U_k \subset \Bbb R\) be open subsets. Define</p>

\[V(t_1, \cdots, t_k, U_1, \cdots, U_k) = \{\gamma \in C_0 : \gamma(t_i) \in U_i \; \forall\, 1 \leq i \leq k\}\]

<p>Let \(p_t(x, y) := \exp(-(x-y)^2/2t)/\sqrt{2\pi t}\) denote the density of the normal distribution \(N(x, t)\) at \(y\). We define:</p>

\[\displaystyle \mu_B(V(t_1, \cdots, t_k, U_1, \cdots, U_k)) = \int_{U_1 \times \cdots \times U_k} p_{t_1}(0, x_1) \cdots p_{t_k - t_{k-1}}(x_{k-1}, x_k) dx_1 \cdots dx_k\]

<p>One would expect this to be sufficient information to define a probability measure \(\mu_B\) on the full measure space \((C_0, \mathcal{B}(C_0))\). We shall quote the following theorem in order to proceed:</p>

<p><b>Theorem</b>. (Kolmogorov extension theorem) Let \((X_i, \mathcal{B}_i)\) be a family of Borel measure spaces on Polish spaces indexed by \(i \in I\) an arbitrary indexing set. For any subset \(J \subseteq I\) let us denote \(X_J = \prod_{j \in J} X_j\) and \(\mathcal{B}_J = \bigotimes_{j \in J} \mathcal{B}_j\) be the corresponding product \(\sigma\)-algebra. Let \(\mu_J\) be a family of probability measures on the measure spaces \((X_J, \mathcal{B}_J)\) for every finite subset \(J \subset I\) which are Kolmogorov consistent, i.e., for any pair of finite subsets \(J_1 \subset J_2\) of \(I\), and any measurable set \(A \in \mathcal{B}_{J_1}\), \(\mu_{J_2}(\pi_{J_2, J_1}^{-1}(A)) = \mu_{J_1}(A)\). Then there exists a unique probability measure on \((X_I, \mathcal{B}_I)\) which is consistent with the family of measures \(\{\mu_J\}_{J \subset I}\), i.e., for any finite subset \(J \subset I\), and any measurable set \(A \in \mathcal{B}_I\), \(\mu(\pi_J^{-1}(A)) = \mu_J(A)\).</p>

<p>Let us thus enlarge our probability space to \(\Bbb R^{[0, \infty)}\) equipped with the product \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{B}_{\Bbb R}^{[0, \infty)}\). For any finite subset \(J = \{t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_k\} \subset [0, \infty)\), our definition for \(\mu_B\) provides us with a Kolmogorov consistent family of measures \(\mu_J\) on \((\Bbb R^J, \mathcal{B}^{\otimes J})\). Thus, we obtain a measure \(\mu_B\) on \((\Bbb R^{[0, \infty)}, \mathcal{B}_{\Bbb R}^{[0, \infty)})\).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we run into a problem. \(C_0 \subset \Bbb R^{[0, \infty)}\) does not happen to be a measurable set in the product \(\sigma\)-algebra. This is simple enough to see: the product \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{B}_{\Bbb R}^{[0, \infty)}\) is generated by finite cylinder events</p>

\[\prod_{f \in F} U_f \times \prod_{i \notin F} \Bbb R \subset \Bbb R^{[0, \infty)}\]

<p>where \(F \subset [0, \infty)\) is finite and \(U_F \subset \Bbb R\) are Borel. Under countable union of such events, we can form the countable cylinder events \(\prod_{d \in D} U_d \times \prod_{i \notin D} \Bbb R\) where \(D \subset [0, \infty)\) is countable. These are clearly closed under further countable unions and complementation, and thus generates a \(\sigma\)-algebra. Hence, these must be all the possible events appearing in the \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{B}_{\Bbb R}^{[0, \infty)}\). Thus, such events must depend only on countably many time coordinates, which \(C_0\) clearly does not — if continuity of a path was definable by simply looking at countably many points on the path, we would be in trouble!</p>

<p>There is a fairly straightforward analytic fix for this. We switch our point of view to random variables instead of measures once again: So far we have successfully defined a stochastic process</p>

\[\begin{gather*}B : (\Bbb R^{[0, \infty)}, \mathcal{B}_{\Bbb R}^{[0, \infty)}, \mu_B) \times [0, \infty) \to \Bbb R \\ B(\gamma, t) = \gamma(t)\end{gather*}\]

<p>It is moreover clear from construction that \(B\) satisfies all the axioms of a Brownian motion except sample-continuity, by the fact that \(\mu_B\) agrees with an independent vector of normal distributions with variance equal to time-increment on finite cylinder events, which is equivalent to the finite-dimensional distributions of \(B\) to be equal in distribution to the Gaussian distribution:</p>

\[(B_{t_1}, \cdots, B_{t_k}) \sim N(\mathbf{0}_k, \text{diag}(t_1, t_2 - t_1, \cdots, t_k - t_{k-1}))\]

<p>We shall modify this process to be sample-continuous by appealing once again to Kolmogorov:</p>

<p><b>Theorem</b>. (Kolmogorov continuity theorem) Let \(X : (\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \Bbb P) \times [0, \infty) \to \Bbb R\) be a stochastic process. Assume there exists constant \(\alpha, \beta, C &gt; 0\) such that</p>

\[\displaystyle \Bbb E\vert X_s - X_t\vert ^\beta \leq C \vert s - t\vert ^{1 + \alpha}\;\; \forall \; s, t &gt; 0\]

<p>Then there exists a stochastic process \(Y : (\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \Bbb P) \times [0, \infty) \to \Bbb R\) such that \(\Bbb P(X_t = Y_t) = 1\) for all \(t \geq 0\) such that for any \(\gamma &lt; \alpha/\beta\), the sample paths of \(Y\) are locally \(\gamma\)-Holder continuous with probability \(1\). In particular, \(Y\) is sample-continuous.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>. Let us define the sets \(A_n = \{\vert X_{i/2^n} - X_{(i-1)/2^n}\vert  \leq 1/2^{n \gamma} \; \forall\; 0 &lt; i \leq 2^n \}\). Further, define \(B_N = \bigcap_{n \geq N} A_n\); it is an easy exercise to check that for any pair of diadic rationals \(s, t\) such that \(\vert s - t\vert  \leq 1/2^N\), there exists a constant \(K = K(\gamma)\) depending only on \(\gamma\) such that on $B_N$,</p>

\[\vert X_s - X_t\vert  \leq K \vert s - t\vert ^\gamma\]

<p>Notice that \(\Bbb P(\vert X_{i/2^n} - X_{(i-1)/2^n}\vert  &gt; 1/2^{n\gamma}) \leq \Bbb E \vert X_{i/2^n} - X_{(i-1)}/2^n\vert ^{\beta} \cdot 2^{n \beta \gamma}\) by Markov inequality applied to \(\beta\)-th exponent. Thus,</p>

\[\displaystyle \begin{aligned}\Bbb P(A_n^c) \leq \sum_{1 \leq i \leq 2^n} P(\vert X_{i/2^n} - X_{(i-1)/2^n}\vert  &gt; 1/2^{n\gamma}) &amp; \leq 2^{n(1+\beta\gamma)} \Bbb E\vert X_{i/2^n} - X_{(i-1)/2^n}\vert ^\beta \\ &amp;\leq C 2^{n(1+\beta \gamma)} 2^{-n(1+\alpha)} = C 2^{-n\lambda}\end{aligned}\]

<p>where \(\lambda = \alpha - \beta \gamma &gt; 0\), using the hypothesis on the \(\beta\)-th moments of \(X\) and choice of \(\gamma &lt; \alpha/\beta\). Thus, \(\Bbb P(B_N^c) \leq \sum_{n \geq N} P(A_n^c) = C 2^{-N \gamma}/(1 - 2^{-\gamma})\). Since \(\sum_{N \geq 1} \Bbb P(B_N^c) &lt; \infty\), by the Borel-Cantelli lemma the probability that infinitely many events \(B_N^c, N = N(\omega) \geq 1\) occur is zero. In particular, for almost every \(\omega \in \Omega\), there exists \(N = N(\omega) \geq 1\) such that \(\omega \in B_N\). Thus, for almost every sample path of \(X\), there exists \(\delta = \delta(\omega) &gt; 0\) such that \(\vert X_t - X_s\vert  \leq C \vert t - s\vert ^\gamma\) holds true whenever \(s, t\) are diadic rationals such that \(\vert s - t\vert  \leq \delta\): take \(\delta = 2^{-N}\).</p>

<p>Finally define the modification \(Y\) of \(X\) by setting \(Y_t = X_t\) if \(t &gt; 0\) is a diadic rational, otherwise find a sequence \(\{t_n\}\) of diadic rationals and define \(Y_t = \lim_n X_{t_n}\) pointwise. This is well-defined since the sample paths \(t \mapsto X_t\) are almost surely continuous on the diadic rationals, which is a dense subset of \([0, \infty)\), hence has a continuous extension to \([0, \infty)\). It remains to be seen that \(\Bbb P(X_t = Y_t) = 1\) for a non-diadic rational \(t &gt; 0\). For any \(\varepsilon &gt; 0\), observe</p>

\[\Bbb P(\vert X_t - X_{t_n}\vert  &gt; \varepsilon) \leq \Bbb E\vert X_t - X_{t_n}\vert ^\beta/\varepsilon^\beta \leq C/\varepsilon^\beta \cdot \vert t - t_n\vert ^{1+\alpha}\]

<p>Thus, \(\{X_{t_n}\}\) converges in probability to \(X_t\). Since the pointwise limit of this sequence in \(Y_t\), we are forced to have \(X_t = Y_t\) almost everywhere. This fully establishes the theorem.</p>

<p>Finally, observe that the process \(B : \Omega \times [0, \infty) \to \Bbb R\) we constructed earlier has the property in the hypothesis with \(\alpha = 1, \beta = 4\) since \(B_t - B_s \sim N(0, \vert t - s\vert )\) for all \(t, s &gt; 0\), hence has fourth moment proportional to \(\vert t - s\vert ^2\). Thus, using Kolmogorov’s continuity theorem, we can modify \(B\) to be a sample-continuous process. This concludes the construction of a 1-dimensional Brownian motion.</p>
