        <p>Broadly speaking, a discrete-time dynamical system is a “space” \(X\) along with a transformation \(T : X \to X\), in an appropriate category of “spaces” (topological spaces, measure spaces, …). I think of a discrete Markov chain as a discrete-time dynamical system where the transformation \(T\) behaves “randomly”. Before illustrating this in detail let me reproduce the precise definition, based on Lecture 10 of the course notes <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/parthanilroy/home/teaching/stoch_proc">here</a>.</p>

<p>We shall say a discrete-time stochastic process \(\{X_n\}_{n \geq 0}\) takes values in a countable “state space” \(S\) if \(\mathrm{Range}(X_n) \subseteq S\) for all \(n \geq 0\) and \(S\) is countable. Without loss of generality, we can throw away the “irrelevant states” and let \(S = \bigcup_{n \geq 0} \mathrm{Range}(X_n)\).  We fix a probability distribution \(\mathbf{a} = (a_k : k \in S)\) on the state space, i.e., \(0 \leq a_k \leq 1\) for all \(k \in S\), such that \(\sum_{k \in S} a_k = 1\). Furthermore, let \(P = (p_{ij})_{i, j \in S}\) be a \(\|S\| \times \|S\|\)-dimensional matrix with elements indexed by \(S \times S\), such that for all \(i, j \in S\), \(0 \leq p_{ij} \leq 1\) and \(\sum_{j \in S} p_{ij} = 1\) for all \(i \in S\).</p>

<p>A discrete-time stochastic process \(\{X_n\}_{n \geq 0}\) taking values in a countable state space \(S\) is a discrete, time-stationary, countable-state space Markov chain with initial distribution \(\mathbf{a}\) and transition probability matrix \(P\) if \(X_0 \sim \mathbf{a}\), and for all \(n \in \Bbb N\), \(i_0, i_1, \cdots, i_n \in S\),</p>

\[\Bbb P(X_0 = i_0, X_1 = i_1, \cdots, X_n = i_n) = a_{i_0} p_{i_0 i_1} p_{i_1 i_2} \cdots p_{i_{n-1} i_n}\]

<p>Let us compute the distribution of \(X_n\) on \(S\) explicitly: For any \(i \in S\),</p>

\[\displaystyle \begin{aligned}\Bbb P(X_n = i) &amp;= \sum_{i_0, \cdots, i_{n-1} \in S} \Bbb P(X_n = i, X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}, \cdots, X_0 = i_0) \\ &amp;= \sum_{i_0, \cdots, i_{n-1} \in S} a_{i_0} p_{i_0 i_1} \cdots p_{i_{n-2} i_{n-1}} p_{i_{n-1} i} = (\mathbf{a}^\mathsf{T} P^n)_i\end{aligned}\]

<p>Therefore, \(X_n \sim \mathbf{a}^\mathsf{T} P^n\). Note that therefore the distribution of the process \(\{X_n\}_{n \geq 0}\) depends linearly on the initial distribution \(\mathbf{a}\) on \(S\); to be precise let \(\mathscr{P}(S)\) denote the space of probability distributions on \(S\), then the transition matrix \(P\) acts on this space by multiplying by a row vector on the left: \(T : \mathscr{P}(S) \to \mathscr{P}(S)\), \(\mathbf{a} \mapsto \mathbf{a}^\mathsf{T} P\), which preserves convex combinations, and the result of iterating this operator \(n\) times is the same as running the Markov process for time \(n\), starting from the initial distribution \(\mathbf{a}\). Since the space of probability distributions on \(S\) is convex hull of the Dirac masses \(\delta_i\), \(i \in S\), it suffices to understand the process for these initial distributions. We get,</p>

\[\displaystyle T(\delta_i) = \sum_{j \in S} p_{i j} \delta_j\]

<p>Thus, we abuse notation and write the map \(T : S \to \mathscr{P}(S)\). Note that for any \(i \in S\), \(T(i)\) is the law of the conditional distribution \(X_{n+1} \| X_n = i\) for any \(n \geq 0\). \(T\) is vaguely like a map \(T : S \to S\) determining a dynamical system on \(S\), but the dynamics is no longer deterministic; pushing a point \(i \in S\) forward by \(T\) does not give a point but a “probability cloud” \(T(i) \in \mathscr{P}(S)\) which associates to \(j \in S\) the probability \(p_{ij}\). I learnt this interpretation from Vadim Kaimanovich, and I find it to be an efficient way of thinking. This operator \(T\) is called a Markov kernel. We shall understand the iterates \(T^k\), \(k \geq 2\) to be determined by the rows of the \(k\)-step transition matrix \(P^k\).</p>

<p>One can recover the stochastic process \(\{X_n\}_{n \geq 0}\) on \(S\) from the Markov kernel as follows: Fix an initial distribution \(\mathbf{a}\) on \(S\) and define a probability measure \(\Bbb P_{\mathbf{a}}\) on \(S^{\Bbb N_0}\) by defining it on cylinder events in a natural way:</p>

\[\displaystyle \Bbb P_{\mathbf{a}}(\{\omega \in S^{\Bbb N_0} : \omega_0 = s_0, \omega_1 = s_1, \cdots, \omega_k = s_k\}) = a_{s_0} T(s_0)(s_1) \cdots T(s_{k-1})(s_k)\]

<p>One can think of the probability space \((S^{\Bbb{N}_0}, \mathscr{C}, \Bbb{P}_\mathbf{a} )\) as the background space of all sample paths the Markov chain can take, starting with initial distribution \(\mathbf{a}\) and transition matrix \(P\), with each path carrying their individual likelihoods. Finally, let \(\Sigma : S^{\Bbb N_0} \to S^{\Bbb N_0}\) be the right-shift operator, and define</p>

\[\displaystyle X_n := X_0 \circ \Sigma^{\circ n} : (S^{\Bbb N_0}, \mathscr{C}, \Bbb P_{\mathbf{a}}) \to S\]

<p>This gives a straightforward way of speaking of several notions in dynamical systems in the context of Markov chains. If \((X, T)\) is a dynamical system, \(A \subseteq X\) is a subset, we can speak of the hitting time function \(\tau_A : X \to \Bbb N \cup \{\infty\}\), defined by \(\tau_A(x) = \inf \{k \geq 0 : T^k(x) \in A\}\), to be the first time the forward-orbit of \(x\) goes inside \(A \subseteq X\) under iterates \(T\). Clearly, \(\tau_A(x) = 0\) if \(x \in A\) and \(A \subset X\) is forward-invariant, i.e., \(T(A) \subseteq A\) if and only if \(\tau_{X \setminus A}(x) = \infty\) for all \(x \in A\). In the context of a Markov chain, we define a random variable-valued hitting time  \(\tau_A\) for any subset \(A \subseteq S\) by</p>

\[\displaystyle \tau_A(i) = \inf\{k \geq 0 : (X_k\|X_0 = i) \in A\}\]

<p>We shall say the state \(i \in S\) leads to the state \(j \in S\) if \(\Bbb P(\tau_j(i) &lt; \infty) &gt; 0\). It is easy to see this happens if and only if the set of sample paths in \(S^{\Bbb N_0}\) which reach \(j\) in some finite time has positive \(\Bbb P_i\)-probability, or equivalently \((P^n)_{ij} &gt; 0\) for some \(n \in \Bbb N_0\). This is a reflexive, transitive (since \(P^{n+m} = P^n P^m\)) relation on \(S\) but is not going to be symmetric in general. An easy example is the deterministically monotone Markov chain on \(\Bbb Z\) with kernel \(T : \Bbb Z \to \mathscr{P}(\Bbb Z)\) given by \(T(k) = \delta_{k+1}\), shifting mass one step to the right. Any state only leads to states to the right of it. So we can say that the states that \(i \in S\) leads to form the “forward-orbit” of \(i\) in this “fuzzy” dynamical system. A subset \(C \subset S\) is said to be closed if \(\Bbb P(\tau_{S \setminus C}(i) = \infty) = 1\) for all \(i \in C\), hence these are the forward-invariant subsets of the Markov chain.</p>

<p>We can symmetrize the said relation to form an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(S\), by defining \(i \sim j\) iff \(i\) leads to \(j\) as well as \(j\) leads to \(i\), and in this case state \(i\) is said to communicate with state \(j\). The \(\sim\)-equivalence classes in \(S\) are called communication classes. States achievable in backward time are also achievable in forward time within a communication class. A Markov chain is said to be irreducible if the state space consists of only one communication class. In the measurable space of sample paths \((S^{\Bbb N_0}, \mathscr{C})\), the irreducibility hypothesis essentially says that the paths do not stay trapped in a tube \(A^{\Bbb N_0}\) forever, for some subset \(A \subset S\), which would be a proper communication class if this situation occurs. This vaguely suggests that running an irreducible Markov process from any point will initiate a dynamical system which is chaotic in some sense.</p>

<p>Let us work towards making the last remark incredibly precise. Let \(S\) be a finite state space, \(P\) be a transition matrix on this state space. Recall that \(P : \mathscr{P}(S) \to \mathscr{P}(S)\) acts on the convex set of probability distributions on \(S\) by multiplication on the left, \(\mathbf{a} \mapsto \mathbf{a}^\mathsf{T} P\). Since \(S\) is a finite state space, \(\mathscr{P}(S)\) as a subset of \(\Bbb R^S\) has exactly \(S\)-many extreme points given by the Dirac masses at the points of \(S\), which makes it a simplex of dimension \(\|S\| - 1\). A simplex is a topological disk, and multiplying on the left by \(P\) gives a continuous self-map of this disk, which has to have a fixed point by Brouwer’s fixed point theorem.</p>

<p>Thus, there exists a probability vector \(\mathbf{\pi}\) such that \(\mathbf{\pi}^\mathsf{T} P = \mathbf{\pi}^\mathsf{T}\); such a vector is called a stationary distribution for the Markov chain. If \(P\) is irreducible, there is in fact a unique stationary distribution: Observe that kernel of the matrix \(I - P\) is the space of harmonic functions on the weight graph on \(S\) determined by the Markov chain, that is, \(P f = f\) if and only if \(f(x) = \sum_{y \in S} P_{x, y} f(y)\) for all \(x \in S\). By irreducibility, the weighted graph is connected in the sense that, for any two states in \(S\), there is a path of positive weight connected them in the said graph. Since \(S\) is finite, such a function \(f\) must attain a minimum, which forces it to be constant everywhere by connectedness. This implies \(\dim \ker(I - P) = 1\), hence \(\dim \ker(I - P^\mathsf{T}) = 1\) as well. This shows kernel of \(I - P^\mathsf{T}\) is \(1\)-dimensional, which forces \(\pi\) to be the unique stationary distribution for the Markov chain.</p>

<p><b>Theorem</b>. Let \(S\) be a finite state space, and \(T : S \to \mathscr{P}(S)\) be the Markov kernel for an irreducible Markov chain on \(S\). Let \(\pi\) be the corresponding unique stationary distribution. Then,</p>

\[\Sigma : (S^{\Bbb N_0}, \mathscr{C}, \Bbb P_\pi) \to (S^{\Bbb N_0}, \mathscr{C}, \Bbb P_\pi)\]

<p>is an ergodic transformation.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>. First of all, \(\Sigma\) is easily checked to be measure preserving since \(\pi\) is a stationary measure. Suppose \(A \subset S^{\Bbb N_0}\) is a \(\Sigma\)-invariant subset, that is, \(\Sigma^{-1}(A) = A\). Consider the random variable \(Z : (S^{\Bbb N_0}, \mathscr{C}, \Bbb P_\pi) \to \{0, 1\}\), \(Z = \mathbf{1}_A\). Define the random variables \(Z_k = \Bbb E[Z\|X_0, \cdots, X_k]\) for \(k \geq 0\). Clearly, \(\Bbb E[Z_{k+1}\|X_0, \cdots, X_k] = Z_k\) so \(\{Z_k\}_{k \geq 1}\) forms a discrete-time martingale. Moreover, this martingale is bounded since \(\Bbb E[\|Z_k\|] \leq \Bbb E[\|Z\|]\) for all \(k \geq 1\). Therefore, by Martingale Convergence Theorem, \(Z_k \to Z_\infty\) almost surely, where the only possibility is \(Z_\infty = \Bbb E[Z\|X_1, X_2, \cdots] = Z\) since the \(\sigma\)-algebra generated by \(X_1, X_2, \cdots\) is the full product \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(S^{\Bbb N_0}\), taking conditional expectation with respect to which returns the random variable itself.</p>

<p>Note that by \(\Sigma\)-invariance of \(A\), \(Z \circ \Sigma^n = Z\) for all \(n \geq 1\). Thus,</p>

\[\begin{aligned}\displaystyle Z_k(\omega) &amp;= \Bbb E[Z\|X_0 = \omega_0, \cdots, X_k=\omega_k] \\ &amp;= \Bbb E[Z \circ \Sigma^k\|X_0=\omega_0, \cdots, X_k=\omega_k] \\ &amp;= \Bbb E[Z \circ \Sigma^k\|X_k=\omega_k] \\ &amp;= \Bbb E[Z\|X_0=\omega_k]\end{aligned}\]

<p>For every \(\omega \in S^{\Bbb N_0}\). As \(Z_k \to Z\) almost surely, for \(\Bbb P_\pi\)-almost every \(\omega \in S^{\Bbb N_0}\) we get \(\Bbb E[Z\|X_0 = \omega_k] = Z(\omega)\). By irreducibility, for every state \(s \in S\), \(\Bbb P_\pi\)-almost every sample path visit \(s\) infinitely often. Thus, \(Z = \Bbb E[Z\|X_0 = s]\) almost surely for every state \(s \in S\). In particular, \(Z\) is a degenerate random variable, so \(\Bbb P_\pi(A)\) is either \(0\) or \(1\). This establishes ergodicity.</p>
