<meta name="description" content="In the subsequent series of posts I would like to talk about certain comparison theorems in Riemannian geometry while learning them. I have a very rough sketch of what I would like to do, but it seemed like an enticing idea to start writing my thoughts down somewhere. I will start by introducing Jacobi fields in this post, which will be used crucially when discussing comparison theorems and what they are. While writing this I have used do Carmo, “Riemannian Geometry” and Milnor, “Morse Theory” as references and inspiration, and strongly recommend looking through both for more detail and perspective." />
